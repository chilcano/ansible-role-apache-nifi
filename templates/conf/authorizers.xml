        The FileAuthorizer is NiFi's provided authorizer and has the following properties:

        - Authorizations File - The file where the FileAuthorizer will store policies.

        - Users File - The file where the FileAuthorizer will store users and groups.

        - Initial Admin Identity - The identity of an initial admin user that will be granted access to the UI and
            given the ability to create additional users, groups, and policies. The value of this property could be
            a DN when using certificates or LDAP, or a Kerberos principal. This property will only be used when there
            are no other users, groups, and policies defined. If this property is specified then a Legacy Authorized
            Users File can not be specified.

            NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi.properties will also be applied to the initial admin identity,
            so the value should be the unmapped identity.

        - Legacy Authorized Users File - The full path to an existing authorized-users.xml that will be automatically
            converted to the new authorizations model. If this property is specified then an Initial Admin Identity can
            not be specified, and this property will only be used when there are no other users, groups, and policies defined.

        - Node Identity [unique key] - The identity of a NiFi cluster node. When clustered, a property for each node
            should be defined, so that every node knows about every other node. If not clustered these properties can be ignored.
            The name of each property must be unique, for example for a three node cluster:
            "Node Identity A", "Node Identity B", "Node Identity C" or "Node Identity 1", "Node Identity 2", "Node Identity 3"

            NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi.properties will also be applied to the node identities,
            so the values should be the unmapped identities (i.e. full DN from a certificate).
